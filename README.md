# hl2_speedless
HL2 Singleplayer mod that runs on Mapbase. Very WIP, not even really sure what I want to do with it.

IDEAS SO FAR
\\\\\\\\\\\\

Speedless Ability: Bullet time that can be turned on for about six seconds before having to recharge. Can mark targets to shoot with middle mouse (similar to Red Dead Redemption 2) or just shoot normally. Bullets become projectiles that are easier to dodge in bullet time.

Brawl: You don't get a crowbar or any type of specific melee. Instead, you are able to pick up various props and use them as weapons (more specifically chairs, bottles, planks, etc. Not really set on this idea due to the fact I would imagine it'd be hard to program, but it would be quite funny and I think unique). You can also throw said props, damaging enemies. Sort of like a fucked up Gravity Gun.

Akimbo (most likely won't do, but sounds fun): You are able to dual wield every weapon, except for the RPG, and Frag Grenade. You can equip your secondary weapon if you are near one that matches the weapon you're currently holding (for example, if I was already holding an SMG, I can only grab a second SMG if I'm nearby one in the map). You, of course, can decide to chuck your dualwielded weapon if you feel like it. Also, dualwielded weapons have a higher ammo capacity but are less accurate.

Gordon? Who's that?: You don't play as Gordon Freeman. Instead, you play as a refugee named "Thompson Adams" trying to run away from the Combine after they massacreed his whole camp.

May or might not seem a bit ambitious but at the moment I'm just throwing around ideas I think would be cool and fun.
